/**
 * claude-builder.test.ts — the permission decision, exercised directly.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Until 2026-07-27 the builder's `canUseTool` denied only
 * WRITES outside the workspace. The sealed acceptance suite sits on the same
 * host filesystem, two directories above the workspace, and nothing stopped a
 * build from READING it. A builder that reads the held-out tests can satisfy
 * them without satisfying the ticket, which makes `heldOutPass` and
 * `falseFinish` meaningless for that run — and nothing downstream detects it.
 *
 * `decideToolPermission` is a pure function precisely so this can be an
 * EXECUTED check rather than a reviewed one: no CLI is spawned, no quota is
 * consumed, and the negative controls below fail if the deny is ever widened
 * into "deny everything" (which would pass a naive test while breaking builds).
